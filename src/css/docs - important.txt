***   Read calmly to understand better the order of CSS sheets   ***

*BASICS*
*
* This order is made to make a modular use of CSS and HTML. It can be not
* perfect or even it can have some errors,or not being the best way to make
* a modular site, but the idea is make a different way starting with what I
* know about. I hope this structure be a good option! if not, don't worry,
* it's the first base of a page will be remaked in the future
*
*EACH CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE MUST BE REWRITE IN THE DOCS

* all the pages. It contains:
